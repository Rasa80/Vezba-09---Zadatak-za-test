 <p>Stevan Stojanović Mokranjac (January 9, 1856–1914) was a Serbian composer and music educator. <br/>
     His work was essential in bringing the spirit of Valach Serbian unwritten folk poems into organized art. </p> 
<h2>Biography</h2>
<p>He was born in Negotin. From the birthplace of his parents he drew the second last name Mokranjac (literally: resident of Mokranje). <br/>
He graduated from the Belgrade high school, and attended the natural science and mathematics section of the University of Belgrade. <br/>
In 1879 he traveled to Munich where he studied music in the class of Josef Rheinberger. <br/>
After a brief break, he continued to study in Rome in the class of Parisotti, in 1884. Returning to Serbia in 1884 he briefly became <br/> 
the conductor of the Kornelije Stanković choir of Belgrade.
From 1885 to 1887 he studied music in Leipzig, Germany. <br/>
<br/>
Upon his return to Serbia in 1887 he became the conductor of the Belgrade singing society (Belgrade Choir). <br/> 
From 1887 to 1900 he taught music at the Belgrade high school, and in 1901 transferred to Bogoslovija (Belgrade Theological College) <br/>
where he taught church singing. Together with Stanislav Binički and Cvetko Manojlović, Mokranjac founded the first independent <br/>
music school in 1899 - Serbian Music School in Belgrade. He remains the director of this school until his death. <br/>
Today the school bears his name. His work as a melograph bore many transcriptions of thus far unwritten folk songs. <br/>
Stevan Mokranjac died in Skopje, Macedonia (then Kingdom of Serbia), aged 58. <br/>

The town also has a Mokranjac museum.

<h2>Works</h2>
<p>His life was highly influenced by church and folk songs, and he used these two types of music as inspiration for his work. <br/>
His most famous pieces are the fifteen <b><em>Rukoveti</em></b> (Potpourri; literally: "handfuls" or "bunches")- a collection of songs and music <br/> (orchestral suites) 
based on motives of Serbian folk music from Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia Proper, Montenegro, Kosovo and Metohija, <br/> Macedonia and Bulgaria. <br/>
His other prominent folk-based works include <b><em>Primorski napjevi</em></b> (Coastland tunes), and <b><em>Kozar</em></b>. <br/>
A significant number of his works were made for church services. 
Such as the <b><em>Božanstvena Liturgija Svetog Jovana Zlatoustog</em></b> <br/> (The Divine Liturgy of St. Chrysostom), 
from which the <em>Heruvimska pesma</em> (Cherubic hymn) is most famous. <br/>
